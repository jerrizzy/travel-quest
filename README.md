This site is set up using React + Vite

The idea behind Travelquest is to expose people to vacation destinations from all the continents.
This is why you're able to filter destinations by continent.

We built an API that we're fetching all the destinations from. 
Then we used React Router to set up the pages:

DestinationList page.
